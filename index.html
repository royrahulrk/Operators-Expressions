      numbers.
    </p>
    <pre>
            const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
                return a+b
            };
            
            AddTwoNumbers(2,5)
        </pre

    <br />
    <p>2
      You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both
      conditions ( A < 10 and A> B ) are satisfied or not with the help of
      operators.
    </p>
    <pre>
                const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {

                    if (a<10 && a>b) {
                    return "true"

    <p>3
      You are given two numbers A and B . You need to do the following checks:
    </p>
    <pre>
            const Check = (A, B) => 
{
   
      var d=false;
      var c=true;
      if(A%10==0 && B%10==0){
        return c
      }

    <p>4
      You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the
      first digit of that number.
    </p>
    <pre>
const First_Digit = (n) => {
  
        while (n >= 10){
              n=n /10;
        }
          return Math.floor(n);
    
     
  };</pre
    ><br>


    <p>5 You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.

Note: You have to complete Last_Digit function. No need to take any input.</p>

<pre>const Last_Digit = (n) => {
   
    return Math.floor(n % 10);
};</pre>
<br>
<p>6 You are provided with two numbers 
A
 and 
B
 where 
A
 as  divisor and 
B
 as  dividend.Your task is find the remainder.</p>
 <pre>const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
    
  let n= b%a
  return n
};</pre><br>
<p>7 You are provided with two numbers 
A
 and 
B
. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.

Note: You have to complete Multiply_two_number function. No need to take any input</p>
<pre>const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
    n=a*b
    return n
};
</pre><br>
<p> 8 Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as 
A
, 
B
, and 
C
 (out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average.</p>
 <pre>const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
{
 let sum = A+B+C
 return sum
};

const Average = (A, B, C) => 
{
let avg=(A+B+C)/3
return avg
};</pre>
